# Creating The Final ouput data set
This script will be useful in implementing and cleaning up data.
This script will basically do the following:

1. Download and unzip source data
2. Read data.
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
8. Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
